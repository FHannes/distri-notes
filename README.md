# Distributed Systems Notes

This repository contains my notes for the [KULeuven](http://www.kuleuven.be) course of [Distributed Systems [H0N08a]](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H0N08AE.htm). These notes are structured like according to the slides provided for the lectures.

Feel free to send in pull requests with corrections if I made a typo or simply got something completely wrong. Given that the course is taught in English, I would prefer that any additions to the notes, as well as commit messages are written in English.
