# Distributed Systems Notes

This repository contains my notes for the [KULeuven](http://www.kuleuven.be) course of [Distributed Systems [H0N08a]](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H0N08AE.htm). These notes are structured like according to the slides provided for the lectures.

Feel free to send in pull requests with corrections if I made a typo or simply got something completely wrong. Given that the course is taught in English, I would prefer that any additions to the notes, as well as commit messages are written in English.

All of the content in this repository is made available in LaTeX format. This must be compiled into a PDF file (or other format), but an automated build is available from my build server [here](http://latex.fhannes.net/distri-notes.pdf). These builds are updated every hour automatically.
